# 300 - Building Our Application

-We follow the example provide by Open API Generator of generating the API for the Pet Store (see https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/blob/master/docs/usage.md)-


We will use [Swagger Hub](https://swaggerhub.com/) for the creation of the API (version 3.0) as explained in [OpenAPI 3.0: How to Design and Document APIs with the Latest OpenAPI Specification 3.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kwmW_p_Tig).
