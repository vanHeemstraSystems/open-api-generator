## 200 - Create a New API

On the landing page, choose to **Create a New API**

**NOTE**: For demonstration purposes we are going to (re-)create the example API called "**Petstore**" as can be seen at https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json

Enter a unique name for your API and select a Template. Select 'None' for a Blank API.

```
Owner: SOME_ORGANIZATION
```

*NOTE*: We created the SOME_ORGANIZATION organization beforehand, choose whichever name you have created instead.

```
Project: --- None ---
```

As we do not have a project yet, we cannot select a project, so the value will be *None*.

```
Specification: OpenAPI 3.0.x
```

```
Template: None
```

None, since we will be creating the API from scratch, not from a template.

```
Name: Petstore_3.0
```

```
Version: 1.0.0
```

```
Title: Petstore
```

```
Description: A Petstore
```

```
Visibility: Private
```

```
Auto Mock API: Off
```
